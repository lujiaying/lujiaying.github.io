I will be joining the [Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/)'s [Center for Data Science](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science) at Emory University, as a research-track Assistant Professor in Summer 2024.  
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics at [Laney Graduate School](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/), [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), advised by Dr. [Carl Yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) in Emory Graph Mining Lab. I also worked closely with Dr. [Jinho Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html) in syntactic parsing, Dr. [Yuanzhe Xi](https://www.math.emory.edu/~yxi26/) in kernel methods (Gaussian processes).  
Prior to joining Emory, I was a visiting student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Yezhou Yang](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3020558). Before that, I receieved my bachelor and master degrees from BUPT and worked in industry for several years.

My research interests include AI for healthcare, large language models, knowledge graph, multimodal learning.
