I have also been working closely with Dr. [Jinho Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html) in Emory NLP Lab.  
Prior to joining Emory, I was a visiting student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Yezhou Yang](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3020558). Before that, I receieved my bachloer and master degrees from BUPT and worked in industry for several years.
