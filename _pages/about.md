I am a research-track Assistant Professor of Nursing Data Science since 2024, affiliated with the [Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/)'s [Center for Data Science](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science) at Emory University.  
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics at [Laney Graduate School](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/), [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), advised by Dr. [Carl Yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) in Emory Graph Mining Lab.   

My research interests include AI for healthcare, large language models, knowledge graph, multimodal learning.  
[**Openings**] I'm looking for motivated students/interns for research projects. Undergraduate/Master/PhD students are encouraged to reach out.
